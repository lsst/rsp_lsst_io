Portal aspect
#############

The Portal aspect enables interactive scientific data discovery and visualization in a web browser.
It is based on the Firefly tool developed for optical and infrared data analysis at `IPAC <https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/>`_.

Most RSP users will find the Portal aspect to be the most efficient way to browse, display, and
make simple plots with the LSST data sets.

The Portal aspect's functionality can be used to access LSST data
without writing code or using programming languages.
