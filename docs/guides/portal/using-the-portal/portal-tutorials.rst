Portal tutorials
################

The best way to learn how to use the Portal is to work through the tutorials that
are available in the documentation for each data release.

For a list of recent data releases and links to their associated documentation,
visit `rubinobservatory.org <https://rubinobservatory.org/for-scientists>`_.

Generally, the URL for the documentation for any data release is the
acronym for the release number followed by ``.lsst.io``.
For example, to go to the documentation for Data Preview 0 use ``dp0.lsst.io``.
The documentation for Data Release 1 will be at ``dr1.lsst.io``, and so on.
