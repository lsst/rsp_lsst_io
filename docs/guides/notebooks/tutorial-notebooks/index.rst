How to use the Tutorial Notebooks
=================================

The best way to learn how to use a Jupyter Notebook is to open the first of the Rubin/LSST tutorial notebooks which are provided in each user's home directory.

**The "notebooks/tutorial-notebooks" directory is read-only:**
The read-only "notebooks/tutorial-notebooks" directory will *always* contain the most up-to-date versions of the tutorials.
Notebooks can be edited and executed in this directory, but **changes cannot be saved to this directory**.
Users wishing to edit, execute, *and save* versions of these notebooks should copy them to a different path in their home directory.
