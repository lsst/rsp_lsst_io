How to use the Tutorial Notebooks
=================================

The best way to learn how to use a Jupyter Notebook is to open the first tutorial notebook and work through it.

In the menu bar of the Notebook Aspect click on "Tutorials" to see a drop down menu of all
the tutorials in the `tutorial-notebooks repository <https://github.com/lsst/tutorial-notebooks>`_.
Select the desired tutorial (the first will always be an introductory-level tutorial).
A writeable version will automatically open for execution, and will be saved into the folder ``/notebooks/tutorials/``.
