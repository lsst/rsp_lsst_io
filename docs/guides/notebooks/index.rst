Introduction to the RSP Notebook Aspect
#######################################

The Notebook aspect enables you to do scientific analysis in your web browser by running Jupyter Notebooks and shell scripts.
The Notebook aspect is powered by JupyterLab_.

Most RSP users will find Jupyter Notebooks to be the most efficient and powerful way to interact with the LSST data sets.

**Always save and shutdown all notebooks and log out of JupyterLab when you are done with your day's work.**
This is important to preserve resources for other users and to ensure you re-enter the RSP in a known state every time.
To help users avoid issues with stale instances, sessions will be automatically shut-down after 5 days of inactivity, or after 25 days.

This page focuses on the basic instructions for using the RSP Notebook Aspect, and a few FAQs and Troubleshooting Tips.
The full documentation for the RSP Notebook Aspect is available at `nb.lsst.io <https://nb.lsst.io/>`_.
