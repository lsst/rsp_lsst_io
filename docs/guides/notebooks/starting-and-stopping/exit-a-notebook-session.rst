Exiting a notebook session
##########################

Once you’re ready to take a break, exit from the Notebook Aspect to release computational resources to others.
Don’t worry, all your opened notebook tabs are saved.
When you log in later, you can pick right up.

There are a few different menu commands to help you exit from your Notebook Aspect session.

.. _nb-save-and-exit:

Saving all before exiting
=========================

The best way to log out is by clicking on :menuselection:`File --> Save All and Exit`.
This will make sure all your open notebooks and text files are saved before logging out.

.. _nb-exit-without-saving:

Exiting without saving
======================

If you don't want to save open notebooks, click on :menuselection:`File --> Exit Without Saving`.
