Troubleshooting advice for RSP login issues.

New account login issues
========================

Attempts to login will not be successful until your account petition is approved by Rubin staff
(i.e., step 8 of the process to :doc:`../getting-started/get-an-account`).
This can take up to a week; your patience is appreciated.

Sometimes this approval process requires that Rubin staff verify that you have Rubin data rights.
Please check your email's spam folder for a data rights verification
request from `Heather Shaughnessy <mailto:sheather@slac.stanford.edu>`__.

If you are at an institution outside the US or Chile, and you are a member of an international
in-kind contribution team, but your name does not yet appear on the
`list of international data rights holders <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/international-drh-list>`__,
contact your program manager and Heather to be added to the list.


Redirect to new account setup
=============================

In cases where attempts to login are redirected into the process for setting up a new account,
the issue is usually that the wrong identity provider was chosen at login.

Try your other identities (e.g., GitHub, ORCID).
After successfully logging in, link the identity you had tried to use so that it will work next time.
See :doc:`linking-more-ids`.


Forgotten password
==================

Rubin staff do not have access to your password or any other data from your identity provider besides your name.
Follow up with your identity provider.
See :doc:`linking-more-ids`.


Moved institutions (expired identity)
=====================================

If you no longer have access to any of the identity provider(s) associated with your
RSP account, please request assistance.


Requesting assistance
=====================

Please include in your request for account assistance:

* if you have been able to log in before
* any account details you remember (full name, email domain, identity provider, username)
* whether your home directory contains needed data

Regarding the last point,
expunging an existing account and letting you start fresh can be the fastest and easiest option.
But this is only a viable option if there is no data in your home directory you need to retain
(e.g., if it is a very new or very old account).

To request assistance, please post a new topic in the `Support category <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/6>`__
of the `Rubin Community Forum <https://community.lsst.org/>`__.
**Do not include personal information like full email addressess or passwords in Forum topics.**
Rubin staff will respond, and will contact you via email or Forum direct message if confidentiality is required.
