Patch Thursday
##############

.. jinja:: rsp

Every Thursday afternoon we deploy updates and perform routine maintenance actions our various science platform instances, including |rsp-env-link|

This "Patch Thursday" window starts at 15:00 Pacific and typically concludes two hours later.

Dos and don'ts:

* Do continue using the platform, as this is rarely a planned outage period
* Do *save your work early and often* as notebook sessions might sometimes be terminated
* Don't file bug reports during this window; you may be experiencing a transient issue while a service is being restarted, so please wait and confirm you see the problem after maintenance.
