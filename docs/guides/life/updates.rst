Staying up to date
##################

As an RSP user, you will want (need, even) to stay informed on new features and service availability.
Here is how to do that:

Banners
=======

Your RSP's landing page at |rsp-env-link| features banners highlighting timely information.

These are color coded depending on severity.

* Green: New features, new data, and other good news
* Orange: Heads up about minor service issues (including :doc:`patch-thursday`) or important service information
* Red: Typically reserved for major and/or unplanned service outages

In the event where there is an on-going incident, please refrain from reporting bugs that seem related.
Incident banners are removed when we judge the incident resolved.
