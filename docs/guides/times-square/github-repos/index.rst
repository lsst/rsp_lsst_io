Times Square sources notebooks from GitHub repositories.
With a knowledge of Git, GitHub, and Jupyter, anyone on the team can contribute new notebooks or enhance existing ones.
Times Square even shows pull request previews so you and your team can review changes before deploying them.

This documentation section guides you through configuring a GitHub repository for Times Square.
Once you have a repository set up, you can write notebooks following the :doc:`Authoring guide <../authoring/index>`.
